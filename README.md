# calvinandhobbes
Python script that tweets the top daily post from reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes.

Up next: Clean code, comment, host script on server for automation. 

Issues: Linking URL vs permalink. Twitter URL shortener vs Google.

Ideal: Scrape for comic image and tweet directly with linked credit.
